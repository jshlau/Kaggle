# Kaggle Projects

These are some Jupyter Notebooks I have produced utilizing data sets available on Kaggle

##  Directory Details

A breakdown of the directories (one per Kaggle dataset), and what the Jupyter Notebooks are focused upon.

Some projects involved the use of machine learning. All will have exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning (if necessary).

### Auto-mpg

This directory contains a notebook going through some exploratory data analysis on a dataset from the early '90s focused on statistics about cars. Some data cleaning is also performed for this dataset. 

### Wisconsin-breast-cancer-diagnosis

Contains 2 notebooks. One is focused on EDA and selection of features. The other (Final Project) contains further feature selection, and feeding of these features into SKLearn's machine learning algorithms to provide a classification (benign or malignant in this scenario).
